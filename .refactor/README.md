# Refactored New Again Application

This is a refactored implementation of the New Again application that follows the specifications outlined in the refactoring document.

## Key Points of the Refactoring

1. **Preserved Root Folder Code**
   - No code in the root folder has been modified
   - All refactored implementation references original code

2. **Identical UI and Functionality**
   - Maintained identical UI layout, components, and behavior
   - Preserved all buttons, fields, text elements, and font sizes

3. **Code Improvements**
   - Enhanced organization with a modular structure
   - Improved error handling across the application
   - Added comprehensive documentation
   - Introduced utility classes for common operations
   - Added enhanced logging capabilities
   - Improved database operations with better error handling

```

## Core Classes

1. **Application**
   - Main application class that initializes the application
   - Handles the application lifecycle

2. **MainWindow**
   - Main window implementation that extends the original UI
   - Preserves all functionality while improving code structure

3. **DatabaseManager**
   - Enhanced database operations with improved error handling
   - References original database functions for compatibility

4. **ConfigManager**
   - Centralized configuration management
   - Handles loading and saving application settings

5. **TextFormatter**
   - Utility for formatting text consistently
   - Formats phone numbers and license plate numbers

## Running the Application

Execute the `start.py` script in the `.refactor` directory:

```bash
python .refactor/start.py
```

Or make it executable and run directly:

```bash
chmod +x .refactor/start.py
./.refactor/start.py
```

## Testing

Run the tests to ensure the refactored implementation works correctly:

```bash
python .refactor/tests.py
```

## User Guide

### Main Window

The main window displays a table of license plates with their associated phone numbers and notes. The interface includes the following features:

1. **Search Functionality**
   - Search by license plate number or phone number
   - Filter results in real-time as you type

2. **Data Management**
   - Add new license plate entries
   - Modify existing entries
   - Delete entries (with confirmation)

3. **Database Management**
   - Create backups of the database
   - Check database location

4. **Font Size Adjustment**
   - Customize font sizes for buttons, table, and input fields

### Adding a New Entry

1. Click on the "新增" (Add) button
2. Enter the license plate information in the two fields
3. Enter a phone number
4. Add any notes if needed
5. Click OK to save

### Modifying an Entry

1. Select a row in the table
2. Click on the "修改" (Modify) button
3. Update the information as needed
4. Click OK to save changes

### Deleting an Entry

1. Select a row in the table
2. Click on the "刪除" (Delete) button
3. Confirm the deletion when prompted

### Creating a Database Backup

1. Click on the "備份" (Backup) button
2. The backup will be saved to the "backups" directory with a timestamp

### Checking Database Location

Click on the "資料庫位置" (Database Location) button to see where the database file is stored.

## Developer Guide

This section provides information for developers who want to understand or extend the refactored implementation.

### Architecture Overview

The refactored implementation follows these architectural principles:

1. **Facade Pattern**: The `Application` class serves as a facade to the original implementation
2. **Delegation Pattern**: Many refactored classes delegate to original classes to maintain functionality
3. **Utility Classes**: Common functionality is extracted into utility classes
4. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and logging throughout

### Key Components

1. **Application**: The main entry point and controller for the application
2. **MainWindow**: The primary UI component that displays and manages the interface
3. **DatabaseManager**: Handles all database operations with improved error handling
4. **ConfigManager**: Manages application configuration
5. **TextFormatter**: Provides consistent text formatting across the application
6. **RefactoredTableViewHandler**: Enhanced table view with improved features
7. **RefactoredAddPlateDialog**: Enhanced dialog for adding/modifying plates

### Extending the Application

To extend the application with new features:

1. Create new component classes in the appropriate directories
2. Update the main window or relevant classes to use the new components
3. Make sure to maintain compatibility with the original code in the root folder
4. Add appropriate error handling and logging
5. Update tests to cover the new functionality

### Code Style

The refactored code follows these style guidelines:

1. PEP 8 compliant
2. Comprehensive docstrings in all functions and classes
3. Type hints where appropriate
4. Clear error messages and logging
5. Modular organization with appropriate separation of concerns
