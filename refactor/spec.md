# Refactoring Specification for `new_again` Application

## Objectives
- Refactor the `new_again` application without modifying any code in the root folder
- Create a separate refactored implementation that references the root folder code
- Preserve complete functional parity with the existing implementation
- Implement internal code improvements with zero user-facing changes

## Requirements
1. **Code Structure Freedom**
    - Complete freedom to restructure internal code organization in the refactored implementation
    - Permission to rename functions, variables, classes, and files as needed in the refactored code
    - Flexibility to change code flow and implementation patterns outside the root folder
    - Focus on creating elegant, maintainable architecture while preserving root code integrity

2. **Root Folder Preservation**
    - Do not modify any code in the root folder
    - Only reference and build upon the existing root folder code
    - Create new implementations that work alongside the original code

3. **UI Preservation**
    - Maintain identical UI layout, components, and behavior
    - Preserve all buttons, fields, text elements, and font sizes exactly as in the original application
    - Ensure pixel-perfect reproduction of the existing user interface

4. **Code Optimization**
    - Remove redundant or duplicate code in the refactored implementation
    - Resolve conflicting logic where identified
    - Eliminate unnecessary code paths
    - Fix logical inconsistencies discovered during refactoring

5. **Execution Path**
    - The refactored application must be executable via `.refactor/start.py`
    - Entry point should launch the application with full functionality

6. **Acceptance Criteria**
    - End users should perceive no difference in application appearance or behavior
    - Root folder code remains untouched while refactored code references it
    - Application performance should be maintained or improved
